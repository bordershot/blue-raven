# raven-cosm

A library to connect a Rainforest Automation RAVEn Smart Meter
interface to the weMonitor Rainforest API.  Includes a general
thread-safe message passing framework for publish / subscribe and a
stream-based architecture/

## TODO

### rename the repo

Once upon a time, this repository was for pushing RAVEn data to the
cosm.com API.  It no longer serves that purpose, so it would be
appropriate to rename the repository.

### add documentation

Figure out how Python apps are documented and add appropriate comments
and markups to the source files.  Include a roadmap to the files.

### make the app into a proper daemon

see https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts

talk to someone at Roku, Sonos, Slim Devices, etc...they would know
about making bulletproof little appliances
